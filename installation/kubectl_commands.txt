 deployment is responsible for managing and deploying resources (such as pods) and ensuring that they run with the desired configuration, including any changes made to the application.
A deployment ensures that a specified number of identical pods are running at all times. When you apply changes (e.g., updating a container image or modifying configuration), the deployment automatically handles the updates to the pods.

In Kubernetes, a rollout refers to the process of deploying or updating an application managed by a Deployment or StatefulSet. It involves gradually updating pods with new configurations, such as changes in container images or environment variables, ensuring that the update happens with minimal downtime.

To clarify:
Namespace is a logical grouping/group of resources. (group of resources like pods but seperated from other groups) 
It is not just for pods but can contain a variety of Kubernetes resources like:
Pods
Services
Deployments
ReplicaSets
ConfigMaps
Secrets
And many other resources
Key Points:
Grouping of Resources: A namespace is like a container or logical partition that holds a set of Kubernetes resources together. For example, all pods related to a particular application or environment (such as development, testing, or production) can be grouped in the same namespace.
Isolation: Namespaces provide logical isolation. Resources within one namespace cannot interact with resources in another namespace unless explicitly allowed (e.g., via services or networking).
Multi-Tenancy: In a multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster, namespaces help separate and isolate resources for different teams or projects. For instance, one team might use the dev namespace for development work, while another team uses the prod namespace for production

"""Steps to Expose and Access the Application on Your Localhost:
Label the Pod (if necessary): In some cases, you might need to label the pod before exposing it, but you already did this with the command:

sh
Copy
Edit
kubectl label pod mypod1 app=mypod1
This step is optional for some situations, but it helps Kubernetes identify and group resources.

Expose the Pod as a Service: You need to expose the pod to make it accessible via a service. This can be done by creating a service with the NodePort type. You did this by running:

sh
Copy
Edit
kubectl expose pod mypod1 --type=NodePort --name=mypod1-service --port=80
This command exposed your pod on port 80 and mapped it to a port on the node (a NodePort), allowing external access.

Port Forward to Localhost: In case you don't have an external IP for your node (like in your case), you can port forward to your local machine's localhost using the kubectl port-forward command:

sh
Copy
Edit
kubectl port-forward pod/mypod1 8080:80
This forwards the Pod's port 80 to your local machine's port 8080. This allows you to access the application from your machine's browser using localhost:8080.

Access the Application via Web Browser: Once port forwarding is set up, you can open your web browser and access your application by typing:

sh
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8080
This will show the Nginx default page (or whatever your pod is running).

Summary of Key Steps:
Expose the pod (create a service).
Port forward the service/pod to your local machine.
Access the service in your web browser using http://localhost:<local-port> (in your case, localhost:8080).
This should allow you to access the application running inside your Kubernetes pod on your web browser!"""""""""
